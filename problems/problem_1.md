## Immutability is the practice of setting values once, at the moment of their creation, and never changing them. How can immutability help write safer code?

* When a value is set in a way that we do not change it after creating it once. We know what value to expect everytime we are using it in the code , without the fear of it being changed. In other words , codes can be written with minimum margin or error by following the practice of immutability. In turn making the code safe.
