## I want to refactor a legacy system. You want to rewrite it from scratch. Argument. Then, switch our roles.

  

#### In favour of rewriting the legacy code.

- “We’re programmers. Programmers are, in their hearts, architects, and the first thing they want to do when they get to a site is to bulldoze the place flat and build something grand.We’re not excited by incremental renovation: tinkering, improving, planting flower beds.”- Joel Spolsky

- A code rewrite gives the programmer the benefit of experience, in other words you would know the weaknesses, the design flaws, current requirements and future road map of the old/legacy system.

- It is possible to plan for it, design a system that will overcome the challenges and plan for the future.

- Programmers can do wonders with code rewriting, it is possible to choose a different programming language or even replace the core framework of your project.

- It is harder to read a legacy code , which makes debugging a big problem.

- Rewriting the code opens up a whole new world of opportunity, as you can use latest technology. Many times alot of issues faced can be solved using new methods.

  

#### In favour of refactoring the legacy code.

  

- Legacy code refactoring will allow the programmer to slowly replace old pieces of code in the system with new ones.A function, a class or a module can be rewritten in the scope of the same project.

- All of the tests and integrations are there, it’s easy to verify that the refactor didn’t break anything and to make sure the functionality stays the same.

- Whereas in rewriting the code , every test or integration needs to be rewritten, and it is quite possible to miss out on some essential feature.

- Even though the old system may be in “maintenance mode”, there will be that crucial bug or important client request that will require you to work on it, if you are refactoring the legacy code it becomes easier to quickly work through the requirements, and there's no hassle of finding a way to implement the same code in the new system, which would be the case in rewriting the code.

- Programmers (usually the ones who never did a big rewrite) might underestimate the effort it takes to recover all old requirements buried deep in the legacy code.

- Even when the programmer has the old product owners at hand, who still remember why all the features were so important for the business "in the old days", depending on the amount it might be hard to identify and prioritize the core features correctly.

- The majority does not have a documentation of their core business processes and the corresponding functions supported by the underlying software , this might cause a huge problem in case of a code rewrite.\

- There is a reason that programmers always want to throw away the code and start over. The reason is that they think the old code is a mess,they are probably wrong. The reason that they think the old code is a mess is because of a cardinal, fundamental law of programming: It’s harder to read code than to write it.
